The previous AI engineer’s work focused on iteratively building and refining a React-based travel application, Pretty Planet Travels and Events. Key initial tasks involved establishing a modern aesthetic, Indianizing content, and integrating core functionalities like contact forms, social media, and “Book with Expert” buttons. A significant challenge arose from integrating user-provided static HTML pages into the React architecture, which led to numerous bug fixes related to display, forms, and routing. Persistent deployment issues (You need to enable JavaScript) were a recurring problem, despite multiple attempts by the AI to resolve them, leading to the conclusion that external platform deployment control was outside its scope. The engineer successfully integrated Razorpay for payments and added footer payment icons, though visibility was an issue. The trajectory concluded with a comprehensive re-statement of unaddressed issues, indicating several core functionalities (like tour package counts, form validations, WhatsApp/email notifications, and the deployment JavaScript error) are still pending.

The goal is a modern, responsive website for Pretty Planet Travels and Events with a royal blue/gold theme, reflecting sophistication. Initial sections include Hero, About Us, Services, Popular Packages, Testimonials, Gallery, Blog, and Contact. Specific requests encompassed replacing international imagery with HD Indian photos, integrating a provided logo, adding service-specific WhatsApp buttons, updating contact details, realistic Indian tour pricing, integrating social media/WedMeGood, ensuring mobile-friendliness, and integrating static HTML content for Tour Packages (approx. 34 pages) and Events & Weddings. Lead capture for enquiry forms (WhatsApp/email), Razorpay payment integration, and SEO optimization were also required. The application has seen extensive frontend development and includes features like dynamic tour packages, events pages, and initial payment gateway integration in test mode. Persistent issues with deployment and form functionality remain.

The previous AI engineer was immediately addressing a comprehensive list of critical issues re-stated by the user (Chat Message 659). Specifically, the AI was focused on the Tour Packages Enquiry Form to make all fields responsive and mandatory, ensure full enquiry details are sent to WhatsApp (+91 8679333355) and Email (info@prettyplanettravels.com), and display a Thank you for your enquiry! message after submission. The immediate preceding action was an edit to , indicating work on the form's responsiveness, validation, and success message logic. This is part of a larger effort to resolve persistent deployment, content, and form integration issues across the application, which have been frequently reported by the user. The deployment issue (site showing You need to enable JavaScript) is particularly critical and has been a recurring problem throughout the development trajectory.
